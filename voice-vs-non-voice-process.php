                        <p>The question that many businesses ask themselves is which one to choose between voice and non-voice processes. In this blog, let's have a look at what each of these processes are and help you determine which option aligns best with your business needs.</p>

                                <p>The voice process involves real-time interaction between agents and customers via calls.

The following are the tasks that are commonly done in the voice process:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sales calls</li>
                                    <li>Telemarketing</li>
                                    <li>Customer service helplines</li>
                                    <li>Technical support</li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>The key features of this process include real-time communication, personalized interactions, quick issue answers, and the requirement of strong verbal and interpersonal skills.</p>

                                <h3>Non-Voice Process: Meaning and Features</h3>
                                <p>The non-voice process involves communication via multiple text-based channels like email, live chat, SMS, and social media. This process also includes operations like <strong><a href="./content-moderation-service">content moderation service</a></strong>, data entry, and report generation. The list of common tasks under the non-voice process are: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Email support</li>
                                    <li>Social media responses</li>
                                    <li>Live chat assistance</li>
                                    <li>Data entry and processing</li>

                                    <li>Back-office operations</li>
                                    <p>The key features of this process include near-real-time interaction and written communication. It is great for multitasking and handling multiple queries simultaneously.</p>
