                        <h1>Customer Support Vs Customer Service: What's Different</h1>
                        <p>Individuals are very likely to use <strong><a href="./customer-support-services"></a></strong> and support interchangeably, however, there is an elemental difference between the two. This difference between these terms has quite a consequential impact on business design interactions, models of service, and meeting the needs of their customers. Through this blog, let's discuss both of these services and their differences.</p>
        
                        <h3>What is Customer Support?</h3>
                        <p>Customer support is a service that assists a company in offering customers assistance when they are facing an issue or require assistance with a product or service. It is mainly referred to as a technical aspect of customer interaction. This support is necessary because of its reactiveness and providing solutions and solving issues to give customer satisfaction with their queries. </p>
                        <p>It is about providing support through <strong><a href="./omnichannel-support">omnichannel service</a></strong> which is support through email, chat, phone, or social media. The team in customer support assists you with technical issues or in breaking through usage bottlenecks.</p>

                        <h3>What is Customer Service?</h3>
                        <p>Where customer support is reactive, customer service is proactive. The service is about the overall experience that a company offers to its customers. They help build a positive relationship and interaction throughout the customer journey to make them feel valued. There are stages in customer service from actual preceding, during to after a purchase. </p>
                        <p>The service covers making product suggestions, checking in with customers after purchase, and answering queries that are not technical at all. Simply, the <strong><a href="./bpo-services">BPO customer services</a></strong> help align companies in creating a loyal customer base and providing a smoother experience.</p>
